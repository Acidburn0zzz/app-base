// CodeIgniter Translations
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of translations (200+) are found in CodeIgniter, but we don't use
that many yet.  We maintain a much smaller list here (translating is
already hard enough!). 

framework_lang.php contains the list of tags that need translating via the
translation srever.

framework_override.php contains a list of translations that are already
defined.  These are just mapped to their equivalent "base" translation.
